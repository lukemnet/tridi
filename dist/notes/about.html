            <div>
              <p>Tridi is a JavaScript library which creates interactive 360 3D product views based on series of images used as frames.</p>
              <p>It supports all desktop browsers (including IE 10 and IE 11) as well as mobile browsers. It is originally written in TypeScript.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h2>Why another product viewer?</h2>
              <p>The idea of creating product presentations based on sets of rotating images is neither new nor innovative. There are dozens of companies which specialize in creating product presentations from scratch. A few similar open source projects are also available. That kind of product presentation is used on majority of car manufacturers' websites.</p>
              <p>Tridi originated as a quick and dirty replacement for a legacy product viewer on a website I maintained at work. I decided to spend some of my free time after work and build it the way I wanted a library like that to look like: well-documented, thoroughly tested and easy to maintain and integrate into any project.</p>
